## TicTacToe
This is a representation of the classic game tic tac toe. The user can play against a computer that randomly will choose an open space on the board. I have incorporated a sleek design as well as some sounds that I feel impact the mood of the game.

## Calculator
The calculator is a simple four operation application that can be used to add, subtract, multiply, and divide inputed numbers in the web browser.

## Interactive Food Order
This project is a simulation of a simple online order menu. The user can select a main course as well as various toppings, and the total will be calculated and presented in a clean concise manner.
